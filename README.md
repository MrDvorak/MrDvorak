# Hi, stranger! [![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/MrDvorak-27a3e2?style=social&logo=telegram)](https://t.me/mrdvorak)

*I'm a developer and that's my story. First code I wrote on my 15th...
 After that there was no hope of stopping at all.
 I've been coding day after day out over and over again...
 C++, Debian, Shell, Bash, Arch, Ubuntu, Awesome, Lua, Python, C#...
 My eyes turned red and I had realized there would no escape anymore...*

So I'm **Max** *(he/him)*, a professional **C++ Software Developer** at [**Luxoft**](https://www.luxoft.com/).

First time I got the real job at [**PVS-Studio**](https://pvs-studio.com/).
It was a nice place where we'd been working on the **C++** part of the **PVS-Studio** static code analyzer.
Well, technically, I had an experience before. An internship at [**Ingate**](https://ingate.ru/). But it was **C#**...
As I already mentioned, now I work for [**Luxoft**](https://www.luxoft.com/) **Automotive**
with my good old friend **C++** and its companion **Python**.
