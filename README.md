# Hi there! [![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/MrDvorak-27a3e2?style=social&logo=telegram)](https://t.me/mrdvorak)

I am a **C++ Backend Developer** with expertise in building and maintaining fintech B2B services, designing high-performance backend systems powered by modern technologies, such as **PostgreSQL** and **Kafka**. My work focuses on creating reliable, scalable, and efficient backend solutions.

In addition to my backend development expertise, I have a strong foundation in multithreaded application development for **Windows** and **Linux** platforms, which has provided me with a deep understanding of computer science principles and system-level programming. I also have extensive experience in **Python**, using it to write tests, automate tasks, and enhance overall development efficiency.
